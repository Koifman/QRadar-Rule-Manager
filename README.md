# QRadar-Rule-Manager

Python program that allows you to import / export rules directly from/to QRadar, also supports basic github integration which hopefully we'll be able to make into some form of detection-as-code.

How to install?
1. Either download the compiled release under "Releases" page.
2. Run the code directly. Requires the following:

pip3 install pyqt6

pip3 install pyqtdarktheme

pip3 install requests

pip3 install PyGithub
